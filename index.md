## Hello There!

My name is Santiago and I am (currently) a **Y2 Game Programming Student** at BUAS. **I specialize in Engine Programming, but I am also very familiar Graphics**. Currently working with **C++**, but also studying **Rust** in my free time. 

Here you can find many interesting articles I have written about my work. **Want to reach out?** You can contact me through **GitHub**, **Gmail** or **LinkedIn**, which you can find in **About Me** or at the **bottom of this page**.
